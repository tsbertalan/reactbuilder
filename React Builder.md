# React Builder

Package for building React projects outside your source tree, so `node_modules` doesn't tie up your cloud storage for an hour syncing a bunch of easily recreatable files.

Note that I installed npm with [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) on Windows 10.
