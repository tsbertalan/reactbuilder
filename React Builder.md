# React Builder

Package for building React projects outside your source tree, so `node_modules` doesn't tie up your cloud storage for an hour syncing a bunch of easily recreatable files.

Note that I installed npm with `choco install nodist` in an elevated powershell on Windows, and then had to also add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Nodist\bin` to the Path in Control Panel > Environment Variables.
